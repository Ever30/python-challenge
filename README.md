# python-challenge

In this challenge, we test some of the functions that we learned during this Python week.

# Instructions

PyBank Instructions

In this Challenge, you are tasked with creating a Python script to analyze the financial records of your company. You will be given a financial dataset called budget_data.csv. The dataset is composed of two columns: "Date" and "Profit/Losses".
Your task is to create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following values:
•	The total number of months included in the dataset
•	The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
•	The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes
•	The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
•	The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

PyPoll Instructions

In this Challenge, you are tasked with helping a small, rural town modernize its vote-counting process.
You will be given a set of poll data called election_data.csv. The dataset is composed of three columns: "Voter ID", "County", and "Candidate". Your task is to create a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following values:
•	The total number of votes cast
•	A complete list of candidates who received votes
•	The percentage of votes each candidate won
•	The total number of votes each candidate won
•	The winner of the election based on popular vote
 

# Resources 

To perform this task, I used activity "01-Evr_Cereal_Cleaner" as a reference to started coding. I used activity "07-stu_Functions" as a reference to get the average. I also used the activity "10-Ins_WriteCSV" as a referencia to export the results and create a new file in the "analysis" file. It is worth mentioning that I also got help from my classmates in the study groups and videos from yuotube.com like this one:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aftw0WX4oCc, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1ZAVEmRwyI. In this video I faund the function to export mi results in differents (\n), https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkW1RwEc8PU and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdLb0hpuWcI.
